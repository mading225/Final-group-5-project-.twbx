Group project work
Project Problem: Low productivity level of the crops due to intense droughts, as well as pest and disease outbreaks in Karamoja.
Objective:


Developing an interactive visualization tool of the results for the first crop season that will be used as a first mockup of the Food Security Monitoring tool that DDI will develop for the NGO.
Expectations:
At least a map in the dashboard
The possibility of visualizing the results by district or sub-county (two administrative levels used by the NGO)

Our data uses data analysis and visualization in Tableau to explore crop yields, production, and population across Karamoja.

By comparing maize and sorghum performance, we aim to identify trends, highlight vulnerable areas, and propose recommendations to improve food security
How the project was studied:

We combined shapefiles, crop production data, and population data usisng Tableau 

We built maps,bar charts, combo charts, and heatmap to visualize yield differences and production patterns.

We also created calculated field,filters,and interactive dashboards for deeper analysis.

Our analysis of sorghum and maize production in Karamoja shows that sorghum generally performs better under drought, while maize has inconsistent yields.
Population pressure is highest in certain subcounties , increasing the need for targeted support .
Crop areas vary wildly, which affects food security in the region
